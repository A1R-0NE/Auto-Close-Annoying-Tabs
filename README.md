# Auto Close Blocked Tabs

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

I'm done with ads or sites opening new tab redirects and manually closing them. So I made a simple and lightweight browser extension that **automatically** closes annoying and unwanted redirect tabs based on a personal blocklist.

## 🚀 Features

* **Auto-Close:** Instantly closes tabs whose URL or Title matches a keyword on your blocklist.
* **Custom List:** Easily add or remove keywords and sites from your list.
* **Quick Block:** A "Block This Site" button to quickly add the current website's domain to your list.
* **Syncs:** Your blocklist is synced across your browsers using `chrome.storage.sync`.
* **Lightweight:** Runs efficiently in the background without slowing you down.
